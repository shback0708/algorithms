ch7 - object oriented design

1. Handle Ambiguity - make assumptions
2. Define core objects for whatever we're designing
3. Analyze relationships - Analyze relationships between objects
4. Investigate actions - basically the order of the flow 

Factory method - offers interface for creating an instance of a class

Gotta look into this a little more -> read over the practice problems

ch8 - recursion

Every recursive problem can be done iteratively -> think of the tradeoff 
especially account for the memory

DP - take recursive algorithm and find overlapping subproblems
tabulation is bottom up and top down is memoization 
for tabulation we have to fill every single one of them

ch9 - system design and scalability

How would real life performance look like?
Tradeoff is important

Most time its just designing a scalable algorithm

Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling - Vertical means increasing resources
of a specific node. Horizontal is increase number of nodes
L.B - distribute load evenly

ch10 - sorting and searching

BubbleSort - start at beginning and swap the first two elements and we continue
O(n^2) runtime and O(1) memory

Selection Sort - Move the very smallest to the front, second smallest next go on
O(n^2) runtime and O(1) memory

Merge Sort - divide by half, sort each half, merge them back together
O(nlogn) runtime and memory depends

ch 11 - testing

ch 12 - C and C++

ch 15 - threads and locks

pg 192 - starts with practice problems
