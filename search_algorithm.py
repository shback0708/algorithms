Search Algorithms

two most popular search - linar search & binary search

Linear - O(n) - just start from beginning to end and if not exist, return -1

binary - start searching from the middle of the list/array
if match, return the index
if not match, check if its greater than or less than and repeat
time complexity O(logn)
-> every incorrect guess, it cuts down the list of elements in half
